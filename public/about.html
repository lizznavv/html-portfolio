<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Elizabeth! Most people call me Liz and I am a UX Designer based in Los Angeles, California. I studied Business
  Administration and earned my Bachelor's Degree from Cal State Channel Islands with the desire to build and create something of
  my own. After completing college, I began working in accounting/office administration for the past 5 years which has expanded
  my knowledge and creativity within a work setting.</p>
  
 
<p>My previous work experience has accelerated my overall work ethic with time management, organization and attention to detail.
  Since then, I have further developed my problem solving and system analysis skills. In my current career I have worked closely
  with the marketing team by designing social media posts and firmwide presentations. These projects have leveraged my
  understanding, ability to create, and completely drive my passion in UX Design.</p>

<p><b>Personally, my ultimate goal and intention in designing are to simultaneously create empathy for users while accomplishing 
  business needs.  </b></p>

<p>On a more personal level, I am a major foodie who loves to spend quality time with friends and family. If I am not in the kitchen
  making a mess, I am either at the gym, playing video games, or exploring.</p>
